# Reference

Welcome to the ml5.js reference page! Here you can browse the various categories of functionality that ml5.js provides. We have categorized the functionality of ml5.js based on whether you want to customize the model and train with your own data.

We currently have 2 categories:

* **Pre-trained Model**:
  *  The ml5 *Pre-trained Model* provides ready-to-use models that you directly feed inputs (image, video, audio, text, etc.) and get outputs (labels and confidence scores).
* **Custom Model**
  * The ml5 *Custom Model* allows you to build and train your own machine learning models with your own data right in the browser.

<!-- * **Helpers**:
  *  The ml5 *helpers* category groups ml5 features that are broadly related to machine learning data, working with data, manipulating data, and training a model with data. Part of our helpers includes the [ml5.neuralNetwork](neural-network.md) which allows you to build and train your own neural network right in the browser. You can also explore the [ml5.featureExtractor](feature-extractor.md) to do [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning).
* **Image**
  * The ml5 *image* category groups ml5 features that are related to applying machine learning to images or video.  
* **Sound**
  * The ml5 *sound* category groups ml5 features that are related to applying machine learning to audio. 
* **Text**
  * The ml5 *text* category groups ml5 features that are related to applying machine learning to text.
* **Utils**
  * The ml5 *utils* category are handy functions that make your life easier when working with data, images, etc. -->
